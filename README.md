# **autracoor**

> A foundational exploration of spatiotemporal conflict resolution for decentralized systems.

---

Arbitrating spatiotemporal conflicts to prevent collisions and guarantee provably safe coordination in multi-agent systems operating under uncertainty, through a scalable and verifiable framework for autonomous trajectory coordination.


This repository serves as the initial documentation and conceptual foundation for the `autracoor` project. It begins by outlining a series of foundational problems in kinematics, control theory, and probabilistic robotics that build toward the project's larger goals.  

The detailed problem descriptions can be found in the `/docs` directory.
